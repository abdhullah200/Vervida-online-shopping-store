## Run Locally

1. **Start the application** from the repository root:

```bash
cd src/Vervida.Web
dotnet run
```

2. **Open your browser** to view the application:

```
http://localhost:5235
```

Alternatively, run without changing directory:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Vervida.Web/Vervida.Web.csproj
```

## Product Catalog

The application features **21 premium products** across 4 categories:

### Categories

- **Customer ratings** with star displays
- **Detailed descriptions** for each product

## Development Notes

- **Environment-based API routing**: In Development, the app uses the local API at `http://localhost:5235/api/LocalProductsApi`. In Production, it would route to an external API like `https://fakestoreapi.com`
- **Local API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/LocalProductsApi/products` ‚Äî List all products (21 items)
  - `GET /api/LocalProductsApi/products/{id}` ‚Äî Get product by ID
  - `GET /api/LocalProductsApi/products/category/{category}` ‚Äî Filter by category
  - `GET /api/LocalProductsApi/products/categories` ‚Äî List all categories

## UI Architecture

### Views & Controllers
- **ProductsController** - Handles product listing, filtering, search, and details
- **HomeController** - Landing page with interactive 3D graphics and contact form
- **LocalProductsApiController** - Local API serving 21 sample products

### Frontend Features
- **Cart Management** - Client-side cart with sessionStorage persistence (`vervida_cart` key)
- **Product Modals** - Dynamic product detail popups with quantity controls
- **Search & Filter** - Real-time filtering by category and search terms
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap 5
- **Dark Theme** - Custom CSS with glassmorphism effects and neon accents

### JavaScript Modules
- `wwwroot/js/products.js` - Product interactions, cart management, modal handling
- `wwwroot/js/site.js` - Global site functionality, theme system, animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Couldn't find a project to run"** - Run from `src/Vervida.Web` directory or use `--project` flag with the `.csproj` path
- **Port conflicts** - The app uses port `5235` by default. Check if another process is using this port
- **Missing images** - The local API serves high-quality Unsplash images; check your internet connection if images don't load
- **Cart not persisting** - Cart data is stored in sessionStorage and will reset when the browser session ends

### Development Environment
- **Codespaces/GitHub.dev** - The app is configured to listen on `0.0.0.0` and honors the `PORT` environment variable for proper forwarding
- **Hot reload** - Use `dotnet watch run` for automatic reload during development
- **SCSS compilation** - Run `npm run sass` to compile custom stylesheets (requires Node.js)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8 MVC
- **API Client**: Refit for HTTP client management  
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, custom CSS with glassmorphism effects
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with ES6+ features
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for interactive homepage elements
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Inter)

## Performance Features
